### Problem Statement - PS003007
Taking manual attendance in a large class is a time-consuming and tedious process. The development of a mobile application (Android as well as iOS) will make the attendance recording system faster and more efficient. All academic institutes have WiFi access points inside or near their classrooms. When faculty members need to take attendance during a session, they can simply press the attendance button in the mobile app. Afterward, the attendance session will commence, and students will have the option to submit their attendance using the mobile app, provided they are connected to the same WiFi network. Once the faculty member closes the attendance session, students will no longer be able to submit their attendance. Later on session wise attendance will be available to faculty in MS-Excel format from the server. It can be downloaded from the server.
